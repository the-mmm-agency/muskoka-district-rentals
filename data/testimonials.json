We were a big group and all the bedrooms and ensuites, and seating areas, and patio furniture, and beach, and bar stools (ETC, ETC, ETC) made that place so great and livable. So grateful for the MDR Team making it all happen. The space is spectacular and the customer service is just as good! All good things!",

All of our guests have indicated that they have had a very satisfactory rental experience with Muskoka District Rentals and that they were very attentive to all of their needs. Their application procedure is very thorough, but it benefits both the guests and cottage owners. I highly recommend this very reputable and professional company for anyone wanting a hassle-free rental agency to look after their cottage rentals.",
