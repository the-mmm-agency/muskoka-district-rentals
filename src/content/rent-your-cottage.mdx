##### Owner Feedback

> "I have nothing but praise for Maryrose, Ross and staff at Muskoka District rentals. We have used their services to rent our Muskoka cottage for the last 3 years. All of our guests have indicated that they have had a very satisfactory rental experience with Muskoka District Rentals and that they were very attentive to all of their needs. Their application procedure is very thorough, but it benefits both the guests and cottage owners. I highly recommend this very reputable and professional company for anyone wanting a hassle-free rental agency to look after their cottage rentals." Barb K MacTier- July 2018
